0 NO_ERROR CTREE
Successful operation.

1 PUSR_ERR RTREE
Userfn returned non-zero.

2 KDUP_ERR CTREE
Key value already exists in index.

3 KMAT_ERR CTREE
Could not delete target key value since recbyt does not match
associated data record position in index.

4 KDEL_ERR CTREE
Could not find target key value in index. No deletion performed.

5 KBLD_ERR CTREE
Cannot call DeleteKeyBlind with an index which supports duplicate
keys.

6 BJMP_ERR CTREE
c-tree() function jump table error.

7 TUSR_ERR CTREE
Process has been marked for termination.  Could be caused by having an open transaction that spans more than four log files.  If so either shorten transaction or increase size of log files (see configuration option LOG_SPACE in Server Admin. Guide or #define MINLOGSPACE in Programmer's Reference - Data Integrity chapter).

10 SPAC_ERR CTREE
InitCTree() parameters require too much space.  A memory allocation failed during the c-tree initialization.    A memory allocation failed during the c-tree initialization.  You may need to reduce some of the values (bufs, fils or sects) in your initialization statement (InitCTree, InitISAM, etc.).

11 SPRM_ERR CTREE
Bad InitCTree() parameter(s): either bufs < 3, idxs < 0, sect < 1, or dats < 0.

12 FNOP_ERR CTREE
Could not open file: not there or locked. Either file does not
exist, filnam points to incorrect file name, or file is locked by
another process. Get errno which is stored in c-tree global
variable sysiocod and look up in compiler documentation or errno.h.
When, in server mode, FNOP_ERR is caused by conflicting open requests
the value of sysiocod will be set to FCNF_COD (-8). For example: your
open failed because another process had the file open in exclusive
mode. When, in server mode version 6.05.26a or later, the FNOP_ERR
was caused by a device access error the sysiocod value will be set
to FDEV_COD (-9).

13 FUNK_ERR CTREE
OpenIFile() cannot determine type of file. Files from version
4.3 or earlier must be converted using utility program ctcv43
before they can be accessed by a c-tree 6.0 or newer program. 
After converting the data use rebuild to create new indices.

14 FCRP_ERR CTREE
File appears corrupt at open. This occurs when a process exits
without properly closing, via CloseIFile(), CloseISAM() etc., a
file it has modified. Rebuild file using utility program ctrbld
or function RebuildIFile().

15 FCMP_ERR CTREE
Data file has been compacted (ctcmpc), but not cleared through a 
rebuild. Rebuild data file (but do not force rebuild) using
utility program ctrbld or function RebuildIFile().

16 KCRAT_ERR CTREE
Could not create index file. Either no space is available on
disk or filnam points to improper name. Get errno which is
stored in c-tree global variable sysiocod and look up in compiler
documentation or errno.h. When, in server mode version 6.05.26a or
later, the KCRAT_ERR was caused by a device access error the
sysiocod value will be set to FDEV_COD (-9).

17 DCRAT_ERR CTREE
Could not create data file. Either no space is available on disk
or filnam points to improper name. Get errno which is stored in
c-tree global variable sysiocod and look up in compiler
documentation or errno.h. When, in server mode version 6.05.26a or
later, the DCRAT_ERR was caused by a device access error the
sysiocod value will be set to FDEV_COD (-9).

18 KOPN_ERR CTREE
Tried to create existing index file.

19 DOPN_ERR CTREE
Tried to create existing data file.

20 KMIN_ERR CTREE
Key length too large for node size. There must be room for at
least three key values per node. The node size is given by sect
* 128 where sect is the third InitCTree() parameter.

21 DREC_ERR CTREE
Cannot create fixed length data file with record length smaller
than five.

22 FNUM_ERR CTREE
File number out of range: 0 <= filno < fils where fils is second
InitCTree() parameter. This error may occur if c-tree has not
been initialized (via InitISAM(), OpenISAM(), CreateISAM() or
InitCTree()).

23 KMEM_ERR CTREE
Illegal index member info.

24 FCLS_ERR CTREE
Could not close file. Usually indicates that memory has been
clobbered.

25 KLNK_ERR CTREE
Bad link in deleted node list. Rebuild file.

26 FACS_ERR CTREE
File number (datno, keyno, or filno) is not in use.

27 LBOF_ERR CTREE
Data record position before first actual data record. If recbyt
is correct, then data file header record may be incorrect. If so,
rebuild data file.

28 ZDRN_ERR CTREE
AddKey() called with recbyt = 0.

29 ZREC_ERR CTREE
Data file routine called with recbyt = 0.

30 LEOF_ERR CTREE
recbyt exceeds logical end of file. If recbyt is correct, then
data file header record may be incorrect. If so, rebuild data
file. Could be caused by having a single-user (NOTFORCE) application
sharing files with other applications.

31 DELFLG_ERR CTREE
Next record in delete chain of a fixed record length data file
does not have first byte set to ff (hex). Data file header record
may be corrupt; if so, rebuild data file. This corruption could
have been caused by improper locking on a delete or a rewrite.
It is possible that the C255 constant is incorrect. Compile and
execute cttest to determine proper setting for C255 constant in
ctcmpl.h. If cttest has you change the constant value rebuild
c-tree and your application.

32 DDRN_ERR CTREE
Attempt to delete data record twice.

33 DNUL_ERR CTREE
Attempted to use NULL recptr in call to ReadData(),
ReReadRecord(), ReReadVRecord(), WriteData() or WriteVData(). 
Probably a bad recptr in your index file. Try a rebuild.

34 PRDS_ERR CTREE
Could not find correct predecessor node. Should not show up in a
single user system. Indicates that an index insertion was
interrupted before completion. Rebuild index.

35 SEEK_ERR CTREE
lseek failed in function ctio (ctclib.c). Possible causes are:
out of disk space, corrupted record position in file, or
corrupted file descriptor. In multiuser non-unix could be caused
by not having dummy lock as file 0. Get errno which is stored in
c-tree global variable sysiocod and look up in compiler
documentation or errno.h.

36 READ_ERR CTREE
read failed in function ctio (ctclib.c). Possible cause:
corrupted data record position in file. Get errno which is
stored in c-tree global variable sysiocod and look up in compiler
documentation or errno.h.

37 WRITE_ERR CTREE
write failed in function ctio (ctclib.c). Possible causes are:
out of disk space, corrupted record position in file, or
corrupted file descriptor. Get errno which is stored in c-tree
global variable sysiocod and look up in compiler documentation or
errno.h.

38 VRTO_ERR CTREE
Could not convert a virtually opened file to an actually opened
file. Get errno which is stored in c-tree global variable
sysiocod and look up in compiler documentation or errno.h. Almost
always caused by changing current working directory from within
program when using files with relative paths. If you must change
the current working directory using absolute path names will
usually eliminate this error.

39 FULL_ERR CTREE
The four byte data record position (or node position) address
space has been exhausted.

40 KSIZ_ERR CTREE
Buffers are too small for nodes. Node size was larger when index
was created. In non-server mode the node size is controlled with
the sect setting (sect is third InitCTree() parameter). In
client-server mode node size is controlled with the PAGE_SIZE
configuration parameter on the server. sects * 128 should equal
PAGE_SIZE.

41 UDLK_ERR CTREE
Could not unlock data record. If dummy lock file is in use, be
sure it is file 0 and has a file mode of 3 (FIXED | PERMANENT | SHARED).

42 DLOK_ERR CTREE
Could not obtain data record lock. In a DOS system, be sure that
the network is up and share is loaded. Get errno which is stored
in c-tree global variable sysiocod and look up in compiler
documentation or errno.h.

43 FVER_ERR CTREE
Current configuration parameters are inconsistent with the
configuration parameters at the time of file creation. Trying to
access a 4.x file using 6.x. High-low low-high incompatibility.
Using a parameter file when PARMFILE has not been set in
ctoptn.h.

44 OSRL_ERR CTREE
Data file serial number overflow.

45 KLEN_ERR CTREE
Key length exceeds MAXLEN parameter. Change MAXLEN in ctopt2.h
and recompile c-tree or use a shorter key.

46 FUSE_ERR CTREE
File number is already in use. Trying to open a file that is
already open. Doing an open after a create (create also opens the
file). Could be caused by having fils set too low in your
InitISAM(). Could be caused by having improper setting for PERC_
#define in ctoptn.h (compile and run cttest to check setting).
If cttest has you make changes rebuild c-tree and your application.


47 FINT_ERR CTREE
c-tree has not been initialized. When using the ISAM functions
you must use one of the ISAM initialization functions, not the
lowlevel InitCTree().

48 FMOD_ERR CTREE
A function has been called for the wrong type of file: e.g., a
variable record length function is called for a fixed record
length data file. Possibly using incorrect file number.

49 FSAV_ERR CTREE
Could not save file. Could not write file directory updates to
disk during file extension. Get errno which is stored in c-tree
global variable sysiocod and look up in compiler documentation or
errno.h.

50 LNOD_ERR CTREE
Could not lock index file node. If DOS/Windows make sure
share.exe is loaded. If a dummy lock file is in use, be sure it
has a file mode of 3 (FIXED | PERMANENT | SHARED).

51 UNOD_ERR CTREE
Could not unlock index file node. If a dummy lock file is in
use, be sure it has a file mode of 3 (FIXED | PERMANENT |
SHARED).

52 KTYP_ERR CTREE
Can not use variable-length keys if VARLKEYS has not been defined
in ctoptn.h. After making any changes to ctoptn.h c-tree must be
recompiled. This error could also be caused by using an invalid
key type. Key types 1, 2, and 3 which were supported by c-tree
version 4.3C and earlier are not supported in later versions.

53 FTYP_ERR CTREE
The file's file mode is inconsistent with the compile time
options selected in ctoptn.h. Can not use a transaction processed
file if TRANPROC has not been defined in ctoptn.h. Can not use a
variable-length file if VARLDATA has not been defined in
ctoptn.h. Can not use a superfile if CTSUPER has not been defined
in ctoptn.h. After making any changes to ctoptn.h c-tree must be
recompiled.

54 REDF_ERR CTREE
Attempt to write a read-only file.

55 DLTF_ERR CTREE
Could not delete file. Has another process gained control of the
file?

56 DLTP_ERR CTREE
File must be opened with an EXCLUSIVE file mode for delete.

57 DADV_ERR CTREE
Proper lock is not held (CHECKLOCK/READ).

58 KLOD_ERR CTREE
LOADKEY called with incorrect key number. You cannot continue.

59 KLOR_ERR CTREE
LOADKEY called with key out of order. You may skip this key and
continue.

60 KFRC_ERR CTREE
Percent out of range.

61 CTNL_ERR CTREE
NULL fcb detected during I/O.

62 LERR_ERR CTREE
File must be opened exclusively.

63 RSER_ERR CTREE
Start file / log file serial number error.

64 RLEN_ERR CTREE
Checkpoint past end of log file. Probably due to a mismatch
between the S0000000.FCS (or S0000001.FCS) file and the
Lxxxxxxx.FCS files.  Prior to version 6.04.24 - File name
too long in log file.

65 RMEM_ERR CTREE
Not enough memory during transaction processing.

66 RCHK_ERR CTREE
Log file entry failed to find checkpoint. Usually caused by
using an active transaction log (L*.FCS) for a ctfdmp or ctrdmp
without first stopping and restarting the server. The stopping
and restarting causes a checkpoint to be added to the log.

67 RENF_ERR CTREE
Could not rename file.

68 LALC_ERR CTREE
Could not allocate memory for control list.

69 BNOD_ERR CTREE
Node does not belong to index. Index has become corrupted. Try
rebuilding. If this error is coming from the rebuild process on a
variable-length file the internal space management index has
probably become corrupted. Running a compact on the data file
will rebuild this internal index. Be sure to rebuild after
compaction or use CompactIFile() function to do both.

70 TEXS_ERR CTREE
Transaction already pending.

71 TNON_ERR CTREE
No active transaction.

72 TSHD_ERR CTREE
No space for shadow buffer. Out of memory.

73 TLOG_ERR CTREE
LOGFIL encountered during shadow only.

74 TRAC_ERR CTREE

75 TROW_ERR CTREE
Recovery: bad transaction owner.

76 TBAD_ERR CTREE
Recovery: bad transaction type.

77 TRNM_ERR CTREE
Recovery: file name too long.

78 TABN_ERR CTREE
Transaction abandoned: too many log extents or dynamic dump wait
exhausted.

79 FLOG_ERR CTREE
Could not log file opn/cre/cls/del.

80 BKEY_ERR CTREE
NULL target or bad keyno.

81 ATRN_ERR CTREE
Transaction allocation error.

82 UALC_ERR CTREE
User allocation error. No memory available to allocate.

83 IALC_ERR CTREE
ISAM allocation error.  Unable to allocate memory.

84 MUSR_ERR CTREE
Maximum users exceeded. You have exceeded either the user limit
of your server or server configuration option USERS in ctsrvr.cfg
whichever is lower.

85 LUPD_ERR CTREE
Attempt to reduce write lock to read lock after update.

86 DEAD_ERR CTREE
Dead lock detected.

87 QIET_ERR CTREE
System not quiet: files in use.

88 LMEM_ERR CTREE
Linked list memory allocation error.

89 TMEM_ERR CTREE
Memory allocation during transaction processing.

90 NQUE_ERR CTREE

93 QRED_ERR CTREE
Queue read error.

94 PNDG_ERR CTREE
Pending error: cannot save or commit transaction.

95 STSK_ERR CTREE
Could not start task. You have exceeded either the user limit of
your server or server configuration option USERS in ctsrvr.cfg
whichever is lower.

96 LOPN_ERR CTREE
Start-file/log open error.

97 SUSR_ERR CTREE
Bad user handle.

98 BTMD_ERR CTREE
Bad transaction mode.

99 TTYP_ERR CTREE
Transaction type / filmod conflict. Usually trying to update a TRANPROC
file without having done a Begin(). Could be from doing a Begin(ENABLE)
in a program where ISAM functions are not enabled.

100 ICUR_ERR CTREE
No current ISAM record for data file isam_fil.

101 INOT_ERR CTREE
Could not satisfy ISAM search request for index isam_fil.

102 INOD_ERR CTREE
ISAM parameter file does not exist. Be sure that filnam
parameter points to correct name. isam_fil value is undefined.
Could not open ISAM parameter file.

103 IGIN_ERR CTREE
Could not read ISAM parameter file Initialization record. 
isam_fil is undefined. Be sure that parameter file is not empty.
Be sure that the correct short integer input conversion character
has been specified in ctoptn.h by compiling and running cttest.
If cttest has you change the value you must recompile c-tree
and your application.

104 IFIL_ERR CTREE
Too many data files and indices in ISAM parameter file. Change
ctMAXFIL in ctoptn.h and recompile c-tree. If this is a client-
server application increase c-tree global variable ctmaxparm
(default is 50). isam_fil is undefined.

105 IUND_ERR CTREE
Could not undo a rejected ISAM update. Data file must be
rebuilt. (During the rebuild, look for records with rejected
duplicate key values.) This error is associated with c-tree V4.3
or earlier. 

106 IDRI_ERR CTREE
Could not read ISAM parameter file Data File Description record
for data file number isam_fil. Be sure that the number of
paramaters in the parameter file is consistent with RTREE setting
in ctoptn.h. If RTREE is defined in ctoptn.h extra parameters
are required on the data and index lines of the parameter file.
Since the servers are compiled with RTREE defined they require
these extra parameters as well.

107 IDRK_ERR CTREE
Too many indices for data file number isam_fil in ISAM parameter
file. Change MAX_DAT_KEY in ctopt2.h and rebuild c-tree or reduce
number of keys.

108 IMKY_ERR CTREE
keyno for index file member out of sequence. keyno must equal
host index file keyno plus member number. 

109 IKRS_ERR CTREE
Too many key segments defined in ISAM parameter file for index
number isam_fil. Be sure that parameter file is consistent with
RTREE setting in ctoptn.h. If RTREE is defined in ctoptn.h extra
parameters are required on the data and index lines of the
parameter file. Since the servers are compiled with RTREE defined
they require these extra parameters as well. If this is not the
case change MAX_KEY_SEG in ctopt2.h and rebuild c-tree or reduce
the number of key segments you are using.

110 ISRC_ERR CTREE
Could not read ISAM parameter file Key Segment Description record
for index number isam_fil. Be sure that parameter file is
consistent with RTREE setting in ctoptn.h. If RTREE is defined in
ctoptn.h extra parameters are required on the data and index
lines of the parameter file. Since the servers are compiled with
RTREE defined they require these extra parameters as well.

111 IKRI_ERR CTREE
Could not read ISAM parameter file Index File Description record. 
isam_fil indicates the relative index number for an unspecified
data file. Be sure that parameter file is consistent with RTREE
setting in ctoptn.h. If RTREE is defined in ctoptn.h extra
parameters are required on the data and index lines of the
parameter file. Since the servers are compiled with RTREE defined
they require these extra parameters as well.

112 IPND_ERR CTREE
LockISAM(ENABLE) found pending locks. This is caused by calling
LockISAM() with a mode of ENABLE twice without having called with
a mode of FREE or SUSPEND.

113 INOL_ERR CTREE
No memory for user lock table.

114 IRED_ERR CTREE
First byte of fixed-length data record found by ISAM routine
equals delete flag (hex FF) or resource flag (hex FE). Usually
caused by having a numeric field in the first position of a
fixed-length data record.

115 ISLN_ERR CTREE
Sum of key segment lengths does not match key length for index
number isam_fil. If the duplicate flag is set you must remember
to add 4 bytes to the total key length. Be sure that parameter
file is consistent with RTREE setting in ctoptn.h. If RTREE is
defined in ctoptn.h extra parameters are required on the data and
index lines of the parameter file. Since the servers are compiled
with RTREE defined they require these extra parameters as well.

116 IMOD_ERR CTREE
Bad mode parameter.

117 IMRI_ERR CTREE
Could not read ISAM parameter file Index Member record. Be sure
that parameter file is consistent with RTREE setting in ctoptn.h.
If RTREE is defined in ctoptn.h extra parameters are required on
the data and index lines of the parameter file. Since the servers
are compiled with RTREE defined they require these extra
parameters as well.

118 SKEY_ERR CTREE
NextInSet() or PreviousInSet() called with keyno which does not
match keyno in last call to FirstInSet() or LastInSet().

119 SKTY_ERR CTREE
FirstInSet() called for index with wrong key type.

120 RRLN_ERR CTREE
Data record length exceeds rebuild max. Not enough dynamic
memory for record buffer in ctrbld.c.

121 KBUF_ERR CTREE
Tried to update data with ctISAMKBUFhdr on. On versions prior to
6.5A check file cterrc.h for 121 definition.

122 RMOD_ERR CTREE
Attempt to change between fixed and variable length records
during rebuild. Once a data file is created, its record length
characteristic cannot be changed.

123 RVHD_ERR CTREE
Variable-length data record is not preceded by a valid record
mark. The file has apparently been corrupted. If this is a 
fixed-length file you probably have a record with a value in the
first byte that makes c-tree think it is a variable-length record
or a resource. These values are 0xff, 0xfe or 0xfa. Remember that
you can not store a numeric value in the first byte of a
fixed-length record.

124 INIX_ERR CTREE
Number of indices in index file does not match IFIL structure in
call to OpenIFile().

125 IINT_ERR CTREE
c-tree is already initialized via a previous call to InitISAM(),
OpenISAM(), CreateISAM() or InitCTree().

126 ABDR_ERR CTREE
Bad directory path get.

127 ARQS_ERR CTREE
Could not send request. Fatal communications error. Reestablish
communication with the server and begin again.

138 AMRD_ERR CTREE
Could not get rid of application message.

139 ABNM_ERR CTREE
Badly formed file name.

140 VMAX_ERR CTREE
Variable record length exceeds 65,529 bytes.

141 AMSG_ERR CTREE
Required message size exceeds maximum.

142 SMXL_ERR CTREE
Application MAXLEN in ctopt2.h > server's MAXLEN.

143 SHND_ERR CTREE
Communications handler not installed.

144 QMEM_ERR CTREE
Application could not identify output queue.

145 SCSF_ERR CTREE
No message space. Was login ok? Could not find COMM software.

146 VDLK_ERR CTREE
Could not update available space information in variable record
length data file. Try rebuild.

147 VDLFLG_ERR CTREE
Record pointed to by available space information is not marked
deleted in variable record length data file. Try rebuild.

148 VLEN_ERR CTREE
Attempt to write a variable length record into a file position
which is too small for the record. WriteVData() cannot fit record
at recbyt. If you are using ISAM level functions this could
indicate a corrupt space management index. Try rebuild.

149 VRLN_ERR CTREE
Variable record length passed to AddVRecord() is less than
minimum record length established at file creation.

150 SHUT_ERR CTREE
Server is shutting down.

151 STRN_ERR CTREE
Could not shut down. Transactions pending.

152 LEXT_ERR CTREE

153 VBSZ_ERR CTREE
Buffer in call to variable length read function is too small for
the variable length record.

154 VRCL_ERR CTREE
Attempt to read (ReReadVRecord()) a zero length record from a
variable record length data file. 

155 SYST_ERR CTREE
Native system failure.

156 NTIM_ERR CTREE
Monitor timed-out without event.

158 VFLG_ERR CTREE
Attempt to read (ReReadVRecord()) a record not marked active.

159 VPNT_ERR CTREE
Zero data record position in variable record length function.
Could also be caused by having a file defined with transaction
processing when transaction processing has not been enabled.

160 ITIM_ERR CTREE
Multi-user interference: key value changed between index search
and subsequent data record read. Or more likely: index file and
data file key information do not match. Possible causes are:
corrupt data or index records or numeric in first position on a
fixed-length record. If this data file is being ported from
another machine or compiler check high-low incompatibility
and/or byte alignment of numeric fields.

161 SINA_ERR CTREE
User appears inactive.

162 SGON_ERR CTREE

181 IKMU_ERR CTREE
Could not get dynamic memory for r-tree symbolic index name.

182 IKSR_ERR CTREE
fils > (MAXFIL - ctRT_FILES) where: fils is number of files
specified in c-tree initialization; MAXFIL is maximum number of
files c-tree can have open specified in ctopt2.h (default 50);
ctRT_FILES is the number of file handles r-tree will be allowed
to use specified in ctopt2.h (default 3). If any changes are
made to ctopt2.h you must recompile c-tree and your application.

183 IDRU_ERR CTREE
Could not read file field number values.

184 ISDP_ERR CTREE
Attempt to reallocate set space.

185 ISAL_ERR CTREE

IS_DETAIL_FOR null fill condition in r-tree.

195 IDMU_ERR CTREE
Could not get dynamic memory for data field symbolic name.

196 ITML_ERR CTREE
Exceeded RETRY_LIMIT in RTREAD.C.

197 IMEM_ERR CTREE
Could not get memory for ifil block.

198 BIFL_ERR CTREE
Improper ifil block. There appears to be a null pointer in the
IFIL, IIDX, or ISEG structures. Can also be caused by having
application compiled with different compiler alignment than c-
tree library.
